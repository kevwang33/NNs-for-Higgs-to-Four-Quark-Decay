# ML models for Higgs/Recoil Identification from the Higgs Boson to four quarks decay 

## Data Extraction
Converting the data from ROOT files to numpy arrays stored in a single hdf5 file.

## Neural Networks
Both NNs use the Tensorflow library.
The GNN has a combination of input, output, conv1D and dense layers.
The DNN uses only input, output, and dense layers.
